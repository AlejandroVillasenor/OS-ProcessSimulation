# OS-ProcessSimulation
**Operating System Process Simulation.**
"Scheduling and Processing Algorithms (Developed in the Operating Systems Course at CUCEI School)"

Repository Description:
This repository showcases simulations of various scheduling and processing algorithms used in operating systems, developed as part of the Operating Systems course at CUCEI School. It includes simulations of algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Round Robin, Simple Paging, Multiprogrammed Batch Processing, Simple Batch Processing, and a Producer-Consumer implementation. Each directory represents a specific simulation with files containing the implementation logic. Explore and understand different approaches to process and memory management in computer systems through these simulations.
